Nice work! If you’d like to see the solution, move to the next task. If you’d like to extend your project on your own, you could consider the following:

The NYC transit system also offers reduced fare options for people with disabilities and people who are at least 65 years old. Refactor the TransitCalculator class so that it checks if the rider qualifies for reduced fare and calculates the best reduced fare option if they do.
Pay-per-ride (single ride): $1.35
7-day Unlimited Rides: $16.50
30-day Unlimited Rides: $63.50
NYC isn’t the only city where there are several fare options available! Extend your TransitCalculator to work for a different city. Pick your own, or choose from these below:
